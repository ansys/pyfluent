# Contributing

The PyFluent project welcomes contributions from the community. Please see the
[README](https://github.com/pyansys/pyfluent/blob/main/README.rst) to better
understand the code repository. It is important to note that while the PyFluent
library package is maintained by Ansys and any submissions are reviewed
thoroughly before merging, it's important to foster a community that can support
user questions and develop new features to make the library a useful tool for
all users. As such questions or suggestions are always encouraged, please add
them to the [issues](https://github.com/pyansys/pyfluent/issues) page.

For more information on contributing to PyFluent, see the contributing guide in
the [documentation](https://fluent.docs.pyansys.com).
