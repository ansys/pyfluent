"""REST-based PyFluent settings client and session.

Standalone HTTP transport layer for PyFluent, connecting to Fluent's
embedded web server via REST.  Pure HTTP/JSON — no gRPC, no protobuf,
no code-generated modules, no local settings tree.

* :class:`~ansys.fluent.core.rest.client.FluentRestClient` – pure-Python
  HTTP client using stdlib ``urllib`` only.  Each method makes one HTTP
  call and returns the server's JSON directly.

* :class:`~ansys.fluent.core.rest.rest_launcher.RestSolverSession` – session
  wrapper for an already-running Fluent REST server.

* :func:`~ansys.fluent.core.rest.rest_launcher.connect_to_webserver` – connect
  to an already-running Fluent web server and return a session object.

* :func:`~ansys.fluent.core.rest.rest_launcher.launch_webserver` – **phase 2**
  (future): spawn a local Fluent process with ``-ws -ws-port={port}``.

Example (connect to already-running server)::

    from ansys.fluent.core.rest import connect_to_webserver

    session = connect_to_webserver(
        ip="127.0.0.1",
        port=5000,
        auth_token="my-secret-token",
    )
    client = session._client
    print(client.get_var("setup/models/energy/enabled"))
