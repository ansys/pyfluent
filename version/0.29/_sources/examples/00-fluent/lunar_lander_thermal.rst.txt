Thermal Model of a Lunar Lander Using the Monte Carlo Radiation Model
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This example demonstrates creating and solving a thermal model of a lander on
the lunar surface using Fluent's Monte Carlo radiation solver.

PyFluent uses the following loop at each timestep to retrofit the required
functionality to Fluent:

1. Calculate the current sun vector (direction of Sun relative to observer).
2. Update the radiation direction in Fluent.
3. Change the radiator emissivity depending on whether the louvers are open.
4. Run the solution for 1 timestep.

**Workflow tasks**

The Thermal Model of a Lunar Lander Using the Monte Carlo Radiation Model
example guides you through these tasks:

* Setting up a Monte Carlo radiation model.
* Creation of materials with thermal and radiation properties.
* Setting boundary conditions for heat transfer and radiation calculations.
* Setting up shell conduction boundary conditions.
* Calculating a solution using the pressure-based solver.
* Dynamically updating the Sun direction and lander state at each step.

**Problem description**

The lander is modelled as a hollow 1 m × 1 m × 1 m cube with aluminum walls 3
mm thick, covered in highly reflective multilayer insulation (MLI). To allow
for comparison to empirical data, the landing site is selected to be the same
as that of the Apollo 17 mission, which took measurements of the regolith
temperatures in the Taurus-Littrow valley located at 20.1908° N, 30.7717° E.

The lander has a radiator on the top surface of size 0.7 m × 0.7 m with louvers,
which open above 273 K to reject heat and close below 273 K to retain heat.
The PyFluent API is used to automatically update the radiator state and the
direction of the Sun at each timestep.

The case setup is taken from reference [1_], originally created in ANSYS
Thermal Desktop. It uses a thermal model of the lunar regolith developed in
reference [2_]. Validation data for the regolith temperatures are taken from
measurements conducted by the Apollo 17 mission to the Moon [3_].

Define the function to calculate the Sun vector at the landing site. This is

longitude at the beginning of the simulation, the observer's coordinates, and
the time elapsed in seconds since the beginning of the simulation as inputs.
It returns the Sun's altitude and azimuth as outputs.

Since we are only running 1 timestep at a time, the time step count is set to

created in order of increasing wavelength.

The number of histories is set to 10 million to reduce computation time, but
more may be required for accurate results.

The limits of each band are based on Fluent manual recommendations and on
space industry best practices [4_].

Create materials to represent the vacuum of space (to prevent thermal
conduction through the cell zone representing vacuum) and the lunar regolith
(soil). The thermal conductivity of the regolith and the surface 'fluff' is
strongly temperature-dependent and so must be modelled using an expression.

Cell zone conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the Monte Carlo radiation model only supports radiative transfer
through a cell zone, a cell zone is used to model the vacuum around the
lander. This cell zone must be set to be a solid so that the fluid equations
are not solved there, then it must be assigned to the vacuum material.

simplicity.
