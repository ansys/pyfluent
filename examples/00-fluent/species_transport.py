Modeling Species Transport and Gaseous Combustion
=================================================
"""

# %%
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# This tutorial examines the mixing of chemical species and the combustion of a gaseous fuel.
#
# A cylindrical combustor burning methane (:math:`CH_4`) in air is studied using the eddy-dissipation model in PyFluent.
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to do the following:
#
# * Enable physical models, select material properties, and define boundary conditions for a turbulent flow with chemical species mixing and reaction.
#
# * Initiate and solve the combustion simulation using the pressure-based solver.
#
# * Examine the reacting flow results using graphics.
#
# Problem Description
# -------------------
#
# The cylindrical combustor considered in this tutorial is shown in the following figure.
# The flame considered is a turbulent diffusion flame.
# A small nozzle in the center of the combustor introduces methane at 80 m/s.
# Ambient air enters the combustor coaxially at 0.5 m/s.
# The overall equivalence ratio is approximately 0.76 (approximately 28% excess air).
# The high-speed methane jet initially expands with little interference from the outer wall, and entrains and mixes with the low-speed air.
# The Reynolds number based on the methane jet diameter is approximately :math:`5.7 × 10^3`.

#
#     Combustion of Methane Gas in a Turbulent Diffusion Flame Furnace
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial, we will use the generalized eddy-dissipation model to analyze the methane-air combustion system.
# The combustion will be modeled using a global one-step reaction mechanism, assuming complete conversion of the fuel to :math:`CO_2` and :math:`H_2O`.
# The reaction equation is
#
# .. math:: CH_4 + 2H_2O → CO_2 + 4H_2
#
# This reaction will be defined in terms of stoichiometric coefficients, formation enthalpies, and parameters that control the reaction rate.
# The reaction rate will be determined assuming that turbulent mixing is the rate-limiting process, with the turbulence-chemistry interaction modeled using the eddy-dissipation model.

# In this tutorial we used PyFluent to model the transport, mixing, and reaction of chemical species.
# The reaction system was defined by using a mixture-material entry in the Ansys Fluent database.
