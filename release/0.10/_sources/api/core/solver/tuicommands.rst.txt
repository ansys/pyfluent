===================

Introduction
------------
The solver TUI (text user interface) is exposed in PyFluent in a hierarchy
of Python commands.

See :ref:`ref_user_guide_tui_commands` for general guidance on using the TUI Commands.

The TUI based examples in our gallery, such as in :ref:`ref_mixing_elbow_tui_api`, provide a guide for how to use these commands.
