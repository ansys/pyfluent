Installation
************

To use PyFluent, you need to have a local installation of Ansys. The version of
Ansys installed will dictate the interface and features available to you.

Visit `Ansys <https://www.ansys.com/>`_ for more information on getting a
licensed copy of Ansys.

To install a local version of PyFluent, you need to clone the PyFluent
repository through GitHub Enterprise (https://github.com/pyansys/pyfluent).
Other Ansys Python packages are also available here or through www.pypi.org. 

Once you have access to a cloned repository, you can install the pyfluent
library by using

.. code::

	git clone https://github.com/pyansys/pyfluent.git
	cd pyfluent
	pip install -e .


***************
