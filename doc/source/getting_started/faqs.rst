Frequently asked questions
==========================

What is PyAnsys?
----------------
PyAnsys is a set of open source technologies that allow you to interface Pythonically
with Ansys Fluent, Mechanical APDL, AEDT, and other Ansys products. You can use PyAnsys
libraries within a Python environment of your choice in conjunction with external Python
libraries.

What is PyFluent?
-----------------
PyFluent provides Pythonic access to Ansys Fluent. Its features enable the seamless use of
Fluent within the Python ecosystem and broad access to native Fluent features for performing
actions such as these:

- Launch Fluent using a local Ansys installation.
- Connect to a Fluent instance running on a remote machine.
- Use Fluent's TUI (text user interface) commands for both meshing and solver features.
- Use Fluent's built-in postprocessing capabilities.

PyFluent is bundled with the Fluent installation. You can also download and install PyFluent
separately. For more information, see :ref:`faqs_install`, which appears later on this page.

PyFluent has no GUI (graphical user interface). You interact with PyFluent through the Python
environment of your choice.

How does PyFluent compare to Fluent user defined functions?
-----------------------------------------------------------
PyFluent is conceptually aligned with Fluent TUI console commands and
journaling rather than with user defined functions (UDFs). In other words,
PyFluent is primarily used for automation rather than modifying the solver
behavior.

UDFs continue to be written in C and remain important elements of Fluent
simulations.

While you cannot write UDFs in Python, you can execute PyFluent commands to
compile and load UDFs, similar to how you use TUI commands.

Who should use PyFluent?
------------------------
PyFluent users include engineers, product designers, consultants, and academia.

What can you do with PyFluent?
------------------------------
You can use PyFluent to do tasks such as these:

- Integrate Fluent as a solver seamlessly in your in-house design tools.
- Customize postprocessing, perhaps by using Python's vast external library to
  extend postprocessing capabilities or by automatically generating a PowerPoint
  presentation to show simulation results.
- Use a web app to access jobs running on a cluster, monitor convergence, and
  generate graphs.
- Leverage Python machine learning and artificial intelligence modules,
  especially for models that are solved quickly but can be improved as
  additional knowledge is acquired and applied.
- Use Python to couple different Ansys products together.

How do you install PyFluent?
----------------------------
While :ref:`installation` provides basic information for quickly installing and
launching the ``ansys-fluent-core`` package, these steps explain how to install
all PyFluent packages in a Python *virtual environment*:

#. Install Python if it is not already installed.

   For Python version information, see the answer to the next question.

#. Install Fluent 2022 R2 or later.
#. Set the environment variable for your installed release to point to
   the appropriate Ansys installation folder.
   
   For example, for Ansys 2022 R2, you would likely set the ``AWP_ROOT222``
   environment variable to point to ``C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v222``.

   While you must explicitly set this environment variable on Linux, it should
   be automatically set on Windows.

#. In a command window, use this code to set up and activate a local Python
   virtual environment::

   .. code:: bash

   .. vale off

      # Set up a local virtual environment
      python -m venv venv 

      # Activate the virtual environment on Windows
      venv\Scripts\activate

      # Activate the virtual environment on Linux (csh)
      source venv/bin/activate.csh

      # Activate the virtual environment on Linux (bash)
      . venv/bin/activate

   .. vale on
   
#. In the same command window, use ``pip``, the package installer for Python, to
   install the PyFluent packages::

   .. code:: bash

      python -m pip install ansys-fluent-core   # Use Fluent’s core capabilities (mesh, solve, postprocess)
      python -m pip install ansys-fluent-parametric   # Use Fluent’s parametric capabilities (optional)
      python -m pip install ansys-fluent-visualization   # Use Fluent's postprocessing capabilities with pyvista and matplotlib (optional)


Which version of Python should you use?
---------------------------------------
PyFluent supports Python 3.8 through Python 3.11 on Windows and Linux. Python
3.10 is shipped with Ansys 2023 R2 and later. For example, in a 2023 R2 Windows
installation, the executable file Python 3.10 is typically located at:
``C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v232\commonfiles\CPython\3_10\winx64\Release\python.exe``.

Alternatively, you can download any compatible version of Python directly from
the `Downloads page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ of the Python web
site.

In either case, run the Python executable file as an administrator, selecting
the **Add Python 3.9 to PATH** checkbox on the first wizard page before
proceeding with the installation. On the last wizard page, which indicates that
Python is installed successfully, follow the instructions for disabling the path
length limit if you have long file paths.

Where do you find source code and documentation?
------------------------------------------------
All PyAnsys public libraries are available from the `PyAnsys GitHub account
<https://github.com/pyansys>`_. The **Repositories** page displays the number of
repositories, which are searchable by name. For example, to find all PyFluent
libraries, type ``pyfluent`` in the search option. 

The ``README.md`` file for the PyAnsys GitHub account lists the public PyAnsys
libraries. The links in this list are to the documentation for the respective
libraries. In addition to general usage information, the documentation for a
library includes many practical examples.

How do you launch Fluent using PyFluent?
----------------------------------------
To launch Fluent with PyFluent commands, use this code:

.. code:: python

   import ansys.fluent.core as pyfluent
   session=pyfluent.launch_fluent()


This example shows you how to launch a double precision Fluent session using two
processors and activate the Fluent user interface:

.. code:: python

   session=pyfluent.launch_fluent(precision="double", processor_count=2, show_gui=True)


For additional launch examples, see :ref:`ref_user_guide_launch`. For
descriptions of all parameters, see the :func:`launch_fluent()
<ansys.fluent.core.launcher.launcher.launch_fluent>` method.

.. _faqs_fluentloc:

How does PyFluent infer the location to launch Fluent?
------------------------------------------------------
PyFluent infers the Fluent location based on the following information, in
increasing order of precedence:


#. ``AWP_ROOT<ver>`` environment variable, which is configured on Windows system
   when Fluent is installed, where ``<ver>`` is the Fluent release number such
   as ``232`` for release 2023 R2.  PyFluent automatically uses this environment
   variable to locate the latest Fluent installation. On Linux systems configure
   ``AWP_ROOT<ver>`` to point to the absolute path of an Ansys installation such
   as ``/apps/ansys_inc/v232``.

#. Value of ``product_version`` parameter passed to :func:`launch_fluent()
   <ansys.fluent.core.launch_fluent>`.


How do you learn how to use PyFluent?
-------------------------------------
Depending on how you prefer to learn, you can use any or all of these methods to
learn how to use PyFluent:

- Review the examples in the documentation, working first through those provided
  in the :ref:_ref_example_gallery in this guide and then through those provided
  in the **Examples** sections in the `PyFluent-Parametric
  <https://parametric.fluent.docs.pyansys.com/>`_ and `PyFluent-Visusalization
  <https://visualization.fluent.docs.pyansys.com/>`_ guides.
- Record a journal of your actions in Fluent and review the corresponding Python
  script.
  
  .. note::
     In Fluent 2022 R2, you can record a journal of your actions in Fluent
     meshing to produce a Scheme script. Within that script are embedded
     Python statements corresponding to each recorded meshing workflow
     action. When extracted from the Scheme script, those Python statements
     are valid in the PyFluent context.

  
  Here is a Python command recorded in Fluent:

  .. code:: python

    import :(%py-exec "workflow.TaskObject['Describe Geometry and Flow'].Arguments.setState({r'AddEnclosure': r'No',r'CloseCaps': r'Yes',r'FlowType': r'Internal flow through the object',})")


  Here is the manually translated equivalent command in PyFluent syntax:
  
  .. code:: python

    session.meshing.workflow.TaskObject['Describe Geometry and Flow'].Arguments.setState(({r'AddEnclosure': r'No',r'CloseCaps': r'Yes',r'FlowType': r'Internal flow through the object’,})


- Write scripts, using capabilities such as these:

  - IntelliSense to show available options for any given command. For example,
    in `JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>`_, press the tab key.
  - Standard Python or PyAnsys tooling to print options related to a specified
    object. For example, use ``dir (<object>)`` or ``help (<object>)``.
