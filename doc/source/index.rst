Welcome to PyFluent
-------------------
PyFluent is your gateway to harnessing the power of Ansys Fluent through
Python. It enables engineers and developers to automate, customize, and
streamline CFD workflows using the flexibility of Python.


Why Use PyFluent?
-----------------

- **Automation**: Eliminate repetitive tasks and accelerate simulation workflows.
- **Customization**: Control Fluent behavior with Python for tailored solutions.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual steps and improve reproducibility.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other Python libraries and tools.


How It Works
------------

PyFluent connects to Ansys Fluent and allows programmatic interaction using a
modern Python API. It supports simulation setup, execution, monitoring, and results
extraction.


Compatibility
-------------
PyFluent supports **Ansys Fluent 2024 R2 and later**.

.. note::
   PyFluent is *not supported* when using a **Fluent Pro** license.

.. note::
