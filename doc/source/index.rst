Introduction
------------
Ansys Fluent is a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software
package for modeling fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions in
complex geometries.

Fluent provides complete mesh flexibility, including the ability to solve
your flow problems using unstructured meshes that can be generated about complex
geometries with relative ease. Supported mesh types include:

- 2D triangular and quadrilateral
- 3D tetrahedral, hexahedral, pyramid, wedge, and polyhedral
- Mixed (hybrid)

Fluent also enables you to refine or coarsen your mesh based on the flow solution.

You can read your mesh into Fluent or, for 3D geometries, create your
mesh using Fluent's meshing mode. All other operations are performed within
Fluent's solution mode, including:

- Setting boundary conditions
- Defining fluid properties
- Executing the solution
- Refining the mesh
- Running a parametric study 
- Postprocessing and viewing results

What is PyFluent?
-----------------

PyFluent is part of the `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com>`_ ecosystem that
lets you use Fluent within a Python environment of your choice in
conjunction with other PyAnsys libraries and with other external Python
libraries.

PyFluent implements a client-server architecture. It uses Google remote procedure
calls, or gRPC interfaces, to launch or connect with a running Fluent process as
a server. However, you only need to interact with the Python interface.

You can use PyFluent to programmatically create, interact with, and control a
Fluent session to create your own customized workspace. In addition, you
can use PyFluent to enhance your productivity with highly configurable,
customized scripts.

Features
--------
Some of the many features in the primary package, ``ansys-fluent-core``, allow
you to:

- Launch the Fluent solver in serial or parallel and connect to
  already-running Fluent sessions. For more information, see :ref:`ref_user_guide_launch`.
- Script using Fluent's meshing capabilities. For more information, see 
  :ref:`ref_meshing`.
- Script using all of Fluent's TUI  (text user interface) commands. For more
  information, see :ref:`ref_user_guide_tui_commands`.
- Run more than one Fluent session asynchronously. For more information,
  see :ref:`ref_utils`.
- Retrieve Fluent field data as numpy arrays for custom postprocessing
  using standard Python libraries such as `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
  For more information, see :ref:`ref_field_data`.
- Register function callbacks on Fluent solver events such as when a
  case or data file is read or when the Fluent solver completes an iteration. 
  For more information, see :ref:`ref_events`.
- Retrieve solver monitors such as residuals using the :ref:`ref_monitors`.

Documentation and issues
------------------------

In addition to installation and usage information, the PyFluent
documentation provides an :ref:`ref_index_api`, :ref:`ref_example_gallery`,
and :ref:`ref_contributing` guidelines.

On the `PyFluent Issues <https://github.com/pyansys/pyfluent/issues>`_ page, you can create
issues to submit questions, report bugs, and request new features. To reach
the project support team, email `pyansys.support@ansys.com <pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_.

This module makes no commercial claim over Ansys whatsoever. PyFluent
extends the functionality of Fluent by adding a Python interface
to Fluent without changing the core behavior or license of the original
software. The use of the interactive control of ``PyFluent`` requires a
legally licensed local copy of Fluent. For more information about Fluent,
