Overview
========
The function, :func:`launch_fluent() <ansys.fluent.core.launcher.launcher.launch_fluent>`
launches an instance of Ansys Fluent, running it as a server in the background. Launching 
in solution mode requires no arguments:

.. code:: python

    from ansys.fluent.core import launch_fluent

    solver_session = launch_fluent()

while: 

.. code:: python

    from ansys.fluent.core import launch_fluent

    meshing_session = launch_fluent(meshing_mode=True)

starts Fluent in meshing mode. If the ``meshing_mode`` argument were set to 
``False``, Fluent would be launched in solution mode, exactly equivalent to 
the first example. You can read more in the user guide on :ref:`ref_user_guide_launch` 
and the API documentation on :ref:`ref_launcher_launcher`.

PyFluent can create and initialize multiple, independent session objects, each providing full
access to Ansys Fluent capabilities relevant to its current mode (solution or
meshing).

A solution mode session has an active ``solver`` object, which provides two
distinct interfaces to the solver. The ``solver`` object has a ``tui`` object,
which is a complete Python exposure of the Fluent solver's actual Text 
User Interface. This interface allows straightforward execution of commands and 
modification of settings in a manner that will be familiar to existing Fluent 
users:

.. code:: python

    tui = solver_session.solver.tui

    tui.file.read_case(case_file_name="pipe.cas.h5")

    tui.define.models.energy("yes")

See :ref:`ref_solver_tui` for details of the full hierarchical API
under the ``tui`` object. Some general guidance on 
programming in terms of such an API can be found in :ref:`ref_user_guide_tui_api`. 

The same ``solver`` object also has a ``root`` object, which provides a 
different interface to the Fluent solver. The ``root`` object exposes most of the
solver capabilities covered by the ``tui`` object, while providing significant 
additional interface features that are not possible via the ``tui`` object:

.. code:: python

    root = solver_session.solver.root

    root.file.read(file_type="case", file_name="pipe.cas.h5")

    root.setup.models.energy.enabled = True

    energy_is_enabled = root.setup.models.energy.enabled()

See :ref:`ref_settings` Read more about the full hierarchy of :ref:`ref_settings`
under the ``root`` object. :ref:`ref_user_guide_solver_settings` provides additional
guidance on using both the ``tui`` and ``root`` objects.

A meshing mode session has an active ``meshing`` object, which provides
three interfaces to the mesher.

Like the ``solver`` object, the ``meshing`` object has a ``tui`` object, which
is a complete Python exposure of meshing's Text User Interface. Again, 
straightforward and familiar command and settings interactions are available:

.. code:: python

    tui = meshing_session.meshing.tui

    tui.mesh.prepare_for_solve("yes")

    tui.file.write_case("pipe.cas.h5")
    
See :ref:`ref_meshing_tui` for details of the full hierarchical API under the
``tui`` object. As mentioned above, :ref:`ref_user_guide_tui_api` contains
more general guidance. 

In addition, the ``meshing`` object has ``meshing`` and ``workflow`` properties,
which together provide access to Fluent's `meshing workflows`. This interface
is consistent with the Python meshing workflow interface that Fluent meshing
exposes directly:

.. code:: python

    workflow = meshing_session.meshing.workflow

    workflow.InitializeWorkflow(WorkflowType="Watertight Geometry")

    import_geometry = workflow.TaskObject["Import Geometry"]

    import_geometry.Arguments = {"FileName":"pipe.scdoc.pmdb"}

    import_geometry.Execute()

    meshing = meshing_session.meshing.meshing

    meshing.GlobalSettings.LengthUnit.setState("mm")

See :ref:`ref_user_guide_meshing_workflows` for further examples. The full interface
is documented here: :ref:`ref_meshing_datamodel`.

A session object in either solution or meshing mode provides a more direct
interaction via its ``scheme_eval`` attribute. The argument
to string_eval in the following example is a string that contains any Scheme
code that could be executed in Fluent for the current mode:

.. code:: python

    unsteady = solver_session.scheme_eval.scheme_eval("(rp-unsteady?)")

Surface field and mesh data services are available in solution mode only via
the ``field_data`` object attribute of the session object:

.. code:: python

    surface_data = solver_session.field_data.get_fields()

See here: :ref:`ref_field_data` for more details about ``field_data``.

The connection status of any session can be verified as follows
("SERVING" is returned if and only if the connection is healthy):

.. code:: python

    health = solver_session.check_health()

Streaming of the Fluent transcript can be stopped/started as follows (it is 
automatically started by default):
 
.. code:: python

    solver_session.stop_transcript()

    solver_session.start_transcript()

Streaming of events pertaining to various, specific solver event types can be
enabled/disabled via the ``events_manager`` attribute of a solution-mode session:

.. code:: python

    solver_session.events_manager.start()

..

  Add the following line after fixing events_manager doc
  Event management is detailed further here: <ref to event_manager doc>

The global logging level can be controlled at any time:

.. code:: python

    import ansys.fluent.core as pyfluent
    pyfluent.set_log_level('DEBUG') # by default, only errors are shown
