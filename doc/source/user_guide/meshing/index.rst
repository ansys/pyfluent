Meshing workflow
================
The guided workflows in Fluent meshing are designed to make it easier to generate a
volume mesh starting from CAD geometries. You can use PyFluent to access the guided workflows.

Workflows are divided into the new :ref:`ref_new_meshing_workflows_guide` and :ref:`ref_meshing_workflows_guide`, which align with the journal syntax.
