Meshing Workflow
================
Fluent meshing guided workflows are designed to make it easier to generate a
volume mesh starting from CAD geometries. You can use PyFluent to access the guided workflows.

Workflows are divided into the new :ref:`ref_user_guide_new_meshing_workflows`, and :ref:`ref_user_guide_meshing_workflows` which align with the journal syntax.
