Meshing Workflow
================
Fluent meshing guided workflows are designed to make it easier to generate a
volume mesh starting from CAD geometries. You can use PyFluent to access the guided workflows.

See :ref:`ref_user_guide_meshing_workflows` for the earlier interface that appears
in journals or :ref:`ref_user_guide_new_meshing_workflows` for the improved pythonic interface.
